# Quick-screenshots
An automator action to generate screenshots at predfined widths for a given URL.

For this you will need to install the excellent [Papparazi app](https://derailer.org/paparazzi/).

Then simpy fire up Automator and import this workflow.

##Changing the sizes
By default this action will take 3x screenshots at 1200px, 800px and 480px wide. These can be changed by editing the sizes in each **capture URL** box.

##Running the action.
To start the screen shots, simpy run the workflow and you will be asked for a URL, this url will then be passed to each stage of the action. And you will have 3x screenshots saved to your desktop.

I will add a note explaining how to add more custom sizes at a later date.
